**This is the Autopatch groups Public Preview Addendum ("Addendum") to the Microsoft Product Terms’ Universal License Terms for Online Services** (as provided at: [Microsoft Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/ForallOnlineServices/all) (the "**Product Terms**")) is entered into between Microsoft Corporation, a Washington corporation having its principal place of business at One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington, USA 98052-6399 (or based on where Customer lives, one of Microsoft's affiliates) ("**Microsoft**"), and you ("**Customer**").

For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

Microsoft desires to preview the Autopatch groups service it is developing ("**Autopatch groups Preview**”) in order to evaluate it.

Autopatch groups Preview consists of features and services that are in preview, beta, or other pre-release form. Autopatch groups Preview is subject to the "preview" terms set forth in the Product Terms’ Universal License Terms for Online Services.
