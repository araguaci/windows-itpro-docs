# Microsoft Store for Business and Education

**Applies to:**

- WindowsÂ 10

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The retirement of Microsoft Store for Business and Microsoft Store for Education has been postponed. We will update this notice when a new retirement date is announced. You can continue to use the current capabilities of free apps until that time. For more information about this change, see [Update to Intune integration with the Microsoft Store on Windows](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/update-to-endpoint-manager-integration-with-the-microsoft-store/ba-p/3585077) and [FAQ: Supporting Microsoft Store experiences on managed devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-management/faq-supporting-microsoft-store-experiences-on-managed-devices/m-p/3585286).
> - In April 2023 the Microsoft Store for Business tab was removed from Microsoft Store apps on Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs. An interaction with existing MDM and GPO policies may lead to customers seeing errors when accessing the Microsoft Store app. For more information see [Microsoft Store for Business tab removed](manage-access-to-private-store.md#microsoft-store-for-business-tab-removed).

Welcome to the Microsoft Store for Business and Education! You can use Microsoft Store to find, acquire, distribute, and manage apps for your organization or school.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - As of April 14, 2021, all apps that charge a base price above free are no longer available to buy in the Microsoft Store for Business and Education. If you've already bought a paid app, you can still use it, but no new purchases are possible from businessstore.microsoft.com or educationstore.microsoft.com. Also, you can't buy additional licenses for apps you already bought. You can still assign and reassign licenses for apps that you already own and use from the private store. Apps with a base price of "free" are still available. This change doesn't impact apps in the Microsoft Store on Windows 10.
>
> - Also as of April 14, 2021, you must sign in with your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account before you browse Microsoft Store for Business and Education.
