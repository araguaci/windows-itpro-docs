# Manage settings for Microsoft Store for Business and Education

**Applies to:**

- WindowsÂ 10

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The retirement of Microsoft Store for Business and Microsoft Store for Education has been postponed. We will update this notice when a new retirement date is announced. You can continue to use the current capabilities of free apps until that time. For more information about this change, see [Update to Intune integration with the Microsoft Store on Windows](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/update-to-endpoint-manager-integration-with-the-microsoft-store/ba-p/3585077) and [FAQ: Supporting Microsoft Store experiences on managed devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-management/faq-supporting-microsoft-store-experiences-on-managed-devices/m-p/3585286).
> - In April 2023 the Microsoft Store for Business tab was removed from Microsoft Store apps on Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs. An interaction with existing MDM and GPO policies may lead to customers seeing errors when accessing the Microsoft Store app. For more information see [Microsoft Store for Business tab removed](manage-access-to-private-store.md#microsoft-store-for-business-tab-removed).

You can add users and groups, as well as update some of the settings associated with the Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant.
